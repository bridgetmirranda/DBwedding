# My Frist HMTL/CSS Website
Welcome to my first venture into web development! This project represents my initial foray into the world of HTML and CSS, and I'm excited to share what I've learned and created. I decided to practice by developing my wedding website. 
This README will guide you through the structure of the project and provide some insights into my learning journey.

**Project Structure**
-  index.html: The main HTML file that represents the structure and content of my website.
-  styles/: A directory containing the CSS file.
-  images/: A directory to store any images used in the website.
-  README.md: You're reading it right now!

**Learning Goals**

HTML Basics: I've used HTML to structure the content of my website. You'll find headers, paragraphs, lists, and maybe even some div and sections.

CSS Styling: I've applied styles to make my website visually appealing. From changing colors and fonts to adding margins and padding, I've started to explore the world of CSS.

**Future Improvements**

This is just the beginning since this was designed in 2018. I plan to:
-  Responsive Design: Make my website look good on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
-  JavaScript Interactivity: Add some interactive elements using JavaScript to enhance user experience.
-  Update style and More Content: Expand the content of my website as I continue to learn and explore.

Thank you so much! This is definitely a journey for me and I'm excited to continue learning and improving my skills.
Feel free to explore my website and provide any feedback.  Please remember to be kind :).

Thanks for visiting

Happy learning!
